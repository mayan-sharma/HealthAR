# Health AR

## The Need

Often times, people exercise without any supervision and aren’t able to do it properly. This may result in either not getting expected results, or in some cases even grave injuries.

## Features

- Health AR aims to provide a library of different exercise and aasanas, and guide people towards correct postures.
- People can choose any particular activity from the provided menu and the application indicates when they have reached the correct posture.
- Additionally, there’ll also be a 3-D model side by side, mimicking the posture in real time so the person can really see from a different perspective, what they have to do different.
